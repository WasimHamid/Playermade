                <p>Sports players need technical, tactical, and physical skills in order to be successful.</p>
                <p>Both team and individulaised training programs have often been seen to focus on the technique and tactics aspects of the sport, at the expense of physical resources and qualities required such as strength, speed agility, power and endurance.</p>
                <p>To maintain fitness and a longstanding participation in sport also requires training to include prevention strategies as well as flexibility and mobility training.</p>
